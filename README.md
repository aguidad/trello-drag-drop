# Trello Drag & Drop

This project is a React-based application that implements a drag-and-drop interface using `react-dnd`, `zustand` for state management, and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for styling. The application features a Trello-like UI where users can move cards between different lists.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Move users between different columns (Applied, Shortlisted, Interview).
- **State Management**: Zustand is used to manage the application's state, including the users in each list and the actions to move users between lists.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
